# Sprockets

Utilities module providing shared components for IPF modules.

## How to install

Sprockets is installed as a regular ImpressCMS module, which means you should copy the complete `/sprockets` folder into the `/modules` directory of your website. Then, log in to your site as administrator, go to `System Admin > Modules`, look for the Sprockets icon in the list of uninstalled modules and click in the install icon. Follow the directions in the screen and you'll be ready to go.

## Upgrading from version 2.0

A new "untagged content" preference has been added. You must:

1. Create a new tag called "Untagged" (or something similar).
2. Update the module.
3. Go to the module preferences and select "Untagged" as the default tag for marking unlabeled content.
