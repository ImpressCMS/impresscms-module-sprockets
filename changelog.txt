Version 1.0 Final
=================

- First public release of the module.

Version 1.01
------------

* Remove unused reference to Catalogue module in /class/archive.php (sato-san)

Version 1.1
-----------

* Updated to comply with ImpressCMS 1.3/2.0 specification (no longer compatible with 1.2).

Version 1.11
------------
* Fix slow index page load when gzip enabled on ICMS 1.3.2.

Version 2.0 BETA (29/7/2012)
----------------------------
* Added support for module-specific category trees. Modules can now use Sprockets to maintain their 
own independent category tree. See Contact V1.04 or Library_ipf V1.0 for examples of integration.

* NB: This breaks compatibility of Sprockets with other client modules; however the fixes required 
to restore functionality are minor and updates for all client modules will be issued together with
the final version of Sprockets 2.

Version 2.0 final (15/1/2013)
-----------------------------
- Improve handling of recent content block (number of results returned still leaves a bit to be 
desired).
- Disabled spotlight function of recent content block. To be revisited in a future version.

Version 2.01 beta
-----------------
- Remove paragraph tags from description field of template. Should be entered *in* the description.
- Add additional rights on installation: Copyright, the Publisher. Use this when republishing a work
where the rights belong to an external agency.
- Modified getTaggedItems() to allow it to return content for multiple (specified) modules. The 
$item_type parameter now accepts an single object type as a string, or multiple object types 
(eg article, publication) as an array
- Modified getTaggedItem() so that it retrieves cross-module content sorted by the 'date' field 
common to all Gone Native module objects. It works, however, it is quite inefficient at present, as
it runs a separate query for every module, retrieves all results, sorts and then truncates them. It
would be much more efficient if this could be done in a single query joining all the tables, but
at present I have not been able to find a way to do this.
- Added an extras file for making a PHP block that can display a stream of mixed content from 
across the Catalogue, Events, Library, News, Partner, Programme, Podcast and Project modules. This will 
be incorporated as a formal block eventually (NB: See the block code for configuration options).
- Added a "recent teasers" block. This draws content from across Gone Native modules, displaying a 
teaser and thumbnail image (auto-resized) if available. Can provide a blog-style stream of mixed 
content. Filter by tag, content (item) type, optional simple list mode.
- Deleted the broken "recent content" block, which is redundant.
- Added a cross-module content page (tag.php), which can pull content from multiple modules.
- Added a preference to select which modules tag.php should pull content from.
- Altered getTaggedItems(), it no longer retrieves cross-module content based on taglink_id but 
does a proper cross-table search (via UNION) ordering content by date.
- Added prepareClientItemsForDisplay() to the tag handler. This standardises output from different
objects and deals with inconsistencies in field names etc, to simplify subsequent handling and 
processing.
- Modified rss.php to work with arrays rather than objects.
- Strip HTML purifier notices in rss.php to stop them being encoded and sent to the feed.
